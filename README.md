Notes (for the reckless)
Do not mess with the script if you don’t know what you’re doing.
Click multipliers: The clicks-per-second (CPS) multiplier for each button (left and right) starts at x2 by default,
Avoid setting your CPS multiplier above x10 — unless you want to risk turning your CPU into a space heater.
